MD SAKIF HOSSAIN - Data Analyst Portfolio

About

Hi, I'm Sakif! I have an analytical background in International Business with Data Analytics. I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies and work experience, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, statistical analysis, and business development, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science-related topics.
